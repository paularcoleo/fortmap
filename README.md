Fortmap is a python program designed to use the in-game minimap to record your location throughout a match of Fornite Battle Royale, in order to display your route through the match, for record keeping!

Fortmap uses OpenCV and the Python Imaging Library(PIL) to take screenshots of your game, and find where in the map you are based on the minimap, and track the position through the game. Recently updated for the V2.2.0 Map update.
